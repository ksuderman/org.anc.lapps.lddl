LAPPS Database Definition Language

LDDL is a Groovy DSL (Domain Specific Language) that can be used to initialize a 
service grid database.  

For Windows users, make sure the lddl.bat file and the lddl-x.y.z.jar file are in the same directory. Add the directory to the PATH variable. To do this, go to Control Panel > System and Security > System. Then click on Advanced system settings. Now click on the Environment Variables button. Now find the variable PATH in either the user variables or system variables. Double click on PATH and then click New. Enter the directory where the lddl.bat file and the lddl-x.y.z.jar file is found. 

To run, open command prompt and type "lddl [arguments]".
